# blog-symfony

This blog project is built with the symfony framework, wich uses the MVC architectural pattern.

This project is a complete application where we may manage the content of that website while managing users
and other stuffs ...

Furthermore, I use the ajax query concept to retrieve data form DB and display that to the home page and for
the comment page (users can let instanate comment).  And all of these work thanks to JS :-).

At the end, I also modified the config files because I want to obtain a certain order between the Admin code
and the Web code (for better convenience).

/!\ notice: To run that project, you may find the DB in the DB forlder.
